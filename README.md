This'll be getting updated a bit frequently and you should not expect very good code in this repo (I'm learning literally all of this with very little base knowledge). You can compile and run this on your SEGA Dreamcast using the KallistiOS SDK, which you can get started with at https://dreamcast.wiki/Getting_Started_with_Dreamcast_development
